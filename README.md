# Low-Level Design (LLD) in Python

This repository contains implementations of various Low-Level Design (LLD) problems solved using Python. The focus is on demonstrating clean code architecture, design patterns, and object-oriented programming principles.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of LLD problem solutions, each demonstrating:
- Clean and maintainable code architecture
- Proper use of design patterns
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Scalable and extensible solutions

Each problem is implemented as a separate module with its own directory, following consistent coding standards and best practices.

## Design Principles

This repository follows these key design principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are specific to client needs
4. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLDpython.git
cd LLDpython
```

2. Navigate to any problem directory and run its main file:
```bash
cd <problem-directory>
python main.py
```

## Contributing
