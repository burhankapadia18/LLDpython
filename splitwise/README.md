# Splitwise - Expense Splitting System

A comprehensive expense splitting and balance management system implemented in Python. This system demonstrates object-oriented design principles and provides a complete workflow for managing shared expenses among groups of users.

## üí∞ Overview

The Splitwise system is a Low-Level Design (LLD) implementation that showcases a typical expense splitting application workflow. It includes user management, group management, expense creation, balance sheet calculations, and multiple split strategies.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows object-oriented design principles with clear separation of concerns:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the main demonstration:

```bash
cd splitwise
python main.py
```

### Usage Example

```python
from splitwise import Splitwise
from user.user import User
from group.group import Group
from expense.expense_split_type import ExpenseSplitType
from expense.split.split import Split

# Initialize the system
splitwise = Splitwise()

# Create users
user1 = User("U1001", "User1")
user2 = User("U2001", "User2")
user3 = User("U3001", "User3")

# Add users to system
splitwise.user_controller.add_user(user1)
splitwise.user_controller.add_user(user2)
splitwise.user_controller.add_user(user3)

# Create a group
group = splitwise.group_controller.create_new_group("G1001", "Trip", user1)

# Add members to group
group.add_member(user2)
group.add_member(user3)

# Create expense splits
splits = [
    Split(user1, 300),
    Split(user2, 300),
    Split(user3, 300)
]

# Create expense with equal split
expense = group.create_expense("EXP001", "Dinner", 900, splits, 
                              ExpenseSplitType.EQUAL, user1)

# View balance sheets
for user in splitwise.user_controller.get_all_users():
    splitwise.balance_sheet_controller.show_balance_sheet_of_user(user)
```

## üé® Design Patterns Used

1. **Factory Pattern**: `SplitFactory` creates appropriate split strategies
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different split strategies (Equal, Unequal, Percentage)
3. **Controller Pattern**: Separate controllers for different domains
4. **Composition Pattern**: System composed of users, groups, and expenses

```

## üí° Key Features Explained

### Balance Sheet Calculation
The system automatically calculates and maintains balance sheets for all users:
- **Total Your Expense**: Total amount you've spent
- **Total You Get Back**: Total amount others owe you
- **Total You Owe**: Total amount you owe to others
- **Total Payment Made**: Total amount you've paid
- **User-wise Breakdown**: Detailed balance with each user

### Split Strategies
1. **Equal Split**: Total amount divided equally among all participants
2. **Unequal Split**: Custom amounts for each participant (must sum to total)
3. **Percentage Split**: Percentage-based division (extensible for future use)

### Expense Processing
When an expense is created:
1. Split validation occurs based on split type
2. Balance sheets are updated for all involved users
3. User-to-user balances are calculated and stored
4. Total summaries are updated

- Database integration for persistent storage
- REST API endpoints for web/mobile applications
- Real-time notifications for expense updates
